## 🎯 First Machine Learning Project – Titanic Dataset

### 👋 Overview

This is my first machine learning project using the **Titanic** dataset to predict passenger survival.
I explored and compared three classification algorithms:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Decision Tree**
* **Random Forest**

The goal was to build predictive models, understand how each algorithm works, and improve my skills in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### 🧪 Models & Accuracy

| Algorithm           | Accuracy |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.81     |
| Decision Tree       | 0.81     |
| Random Forest       | 0.82     |

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Google Colab

---

### 📊 What I Did

* Handled missing data and cleaned the dataset.
* Encoded categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`).
* Compared algorithm performance.
* Learned practical and theoretical differences between models.
* Practiced interpreting evaluation metrics (precision, recall, f1-score).

---

### 🌱 What I Learned

* The difference between linear and non-linear models.
* How tree-based models split data and make decisions.
* Importance of cross-validation and avoiding overfitting.
* How to explain a machine learning process clearly and share my work publicly.
